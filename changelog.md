## 2025-09-20
### Modified
- Week 2 Neural Language Models presentations
- Updated figure generation scripts

## 2025-09-12
### Initial Setup
- Repository structure created
- 12-week course framework established
- Common infrastructure:
  - Master template with optimal readability
  - Slide layout macros
  - Color schemes
- Weeks 1-6 initial materials imported
- Python figure generation scripts for all weeks
- Lab notebooks for weeks 2-6

## 2025-07-25
### Legacy Materials
- Original enhanced presentations created
- Initial figure generation scripts
- Basic course structure

## Key Improvements Made
1. **Standardization**: All presentations now use consistent optimal readability template
2. **Visual Quality**: Python-generated figures replace TikZ for better quality
3. **Organization**: Clear directory structure with presentations/, python/, figures/, lab/ folders
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive status tracking and changelog
5. **Build Process**: Streamlined compilation with auxiliary file management

## Known Issues
1. Weeks 8-12 missing main presentations (have enhanced templates)
2. Lab notebooks needed for weeks 1, 7-12
3. Handout materials missing for weeks 5-12
4. Some figures referenced but not yet generated for later weeks

## Upcoming Priorities
1. Week 7 lab notebook creation
2. Week 7 handout materials
3. Week 8 Tokenization complete presentation
4. Systematic completion of weeks 8-12
5. Creation of all missing lab notebooks

## Technical Notes
- Using pdfLaTeX for compilation
- Python 3.x with matplotlib, seaborn for figures
- Madrid beamer theme with custom color scheme
- 8pt font size, 16:9 aspect ratio
- Monochromatic palette: RGB(64,64,64), RGB(180,180,180), RGB(240,240,240)
