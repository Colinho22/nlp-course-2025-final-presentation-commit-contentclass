# DEPRECATED Week 3 Versions

## DO NOT USE These Versions for Teaching

The following presentations are **deprecated** and should not be used:

### 1. `20250922_1458_week03_rnn_with_foundations.pdf` (34 slides)
**Status:** DEPRECATED
**Reason:** Contains 15 slides of neural network foundations that duplicate the NN Primer module

**Problems:**
- Redundant content (neurons, activation functions, backpropagation)
- Too long for 90-minute lecture (34 vs optimal 19 slides)
- Violates modular course design
- RNN equation appears twice (lines 558 and 636)
- Wastes class time re-teaching prerequisites

**Alternative:** Students should complete NN Primer module BEFORE Week 3, then use the 19-slide optimal version.

### 2. `week03_rnn_restructured.pdf` (33 slides)
**Status:** DEPRECATED
**Reason:** Superseded by optimal version, too long

**Problems:**
- Similar redundancy issues to with_foundations
- Unclear structure
- Excessive length

### 3. `week03_rnn_enhanced.pdf` (17 slides)
**Status:** DEPRECATED
**Reason:** Too brief, lacks depth

**Problems:**
- Insufficient coverage of LSTM architecture
- Missing critical concepts
- Not comprehensive enough for Week 3 learning objectives

## USE THIS INSTEAD

**CANONICAL VERSION:** `20250922_1242_week03_rnn_optimal.pdf` (19 slides)

**Why This Version:**
- Appropriate length for 60-90 minute lecture
- Assumes NN Primer prerequisite (no redundancy)
- Focuses on RNN-specific concepts
- Clear, focused content
- All 24 figures correctly referenced
- Mathematical notation verified correct
- Excellent pedagogical flow

## Migration Path

If you were using one of the deprecated versions:

1. **Update your syllabus** to reference `20250922_1242_week03_rnn_optimal.pdf`
2. **Add prerequisite** requirement: Students must complete NN Primer before Week 3
3. **Reference LSTM Primer** for students wanting deeper LSTM coverage (optional 32-slide deep dive)
4. **Update lab materials** to align with the 19-slide version's scope

## For Students Who Used Deprecated Versions

If you already studied from a deprecated version:
- You have NOT missed any RNN-specific content
- The deprecated versions just included extra NN basics that should have been prerequisites
- Focus on the RNN-specific sections (equations, vanishing gradients, LSTM gates)
- Optionally review NN Primer for foundational concepts
